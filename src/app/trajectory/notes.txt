- cubic spline interpolation
  - (x1, y1, theta1) to (x2, y2, theta2)
  - find f(x) from x1 to x2
    - f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
    - f(x1) = y1
    - f(x2) = y2
    - f'(x1) = tan(theta1)
    - f'(x2) = tan(theta2)
  - tan(theta) of waypoint = derivative of segment at that waypoint

- code ideas:
  - install python shell and make sure can call method at certain times, get a loading screen
  - cubicCoeffs = Coeff[], Coeff = {a, b, c, d}
  - split up into waypoint pairs ---- zip?
  - findCubicCoeffs
      //a(waypoint1.x)^3 + b(waypoint1.x)^2 + c(waypoint1.x) + d = waypoint1.y
      //a(waypoint2.x)^3 + b(waypoint2.x)^2 + c(waypoint2.x) + d = waypoint2.y
      //3a(waypint1.x)^2 + 2b(waypoint1.x) + c = tan(waypoint1.theta)
      //3a(waypoint2.x)^2 + 2b(waypoint2.x) + c = tan(waypoint2.theta)
      | (waypoint1.x)^3  (waypoint1.x^2)  (waypoint1.x)  1  |  |a| = |waypoint1.y|
      | (waypoint2.x)^3  (waypoint2.x^2)  (waypoint2.x)  1  |  |b| = |waypoint2.y|
      | 3(waypoint1.x)^2 2(waypoint1.x)   1              0  |  |c| = |tan(waypoint1.theta)|
      | 3(waypoint2.x)^2 2(waypoint2.x)   1              0  |  |d| = |tan(waypoint2.theta)|
      solve that matrix - must be scipy out there or something to do that
      invert the left one
      invert * rightmost = a b c d matrix (flipped other way)
  - tick x = 0.5

- improved parametric ideas
  - tick t = 0.5
  - x1(t1) = a(t1)^3 + b(t1)^2 + c(t1) + d = x1
  - y1(t1) = e(t1)^3 + f(t1)^2 + g(t1) + h = y1
  - x2(t2) = i(t2)^3 + j(t2)^2 + k(t2) + l = x2
  - y2(t2) = m(t2)^3 + n(t2)^2 + o(t2) + p = y2
  - y1'(t) / x1'(t) = tan(theta1)
  - y2'(t) / x2'(t) = tan(theta1)

  - x = t
  - y = blah
