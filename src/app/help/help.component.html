          <h4>Why is it called "snail"/"Acha"/"Achatinidae"?</h4>
          <p>It's not because it's slow! My nickname on my robotics team is snail, so I use it for naming a lot.</p>
          <h4>How do I use this?</h4>
          <p>Add waypoints using the Waypoint Dashboard - these new waypoints will show up on the "Preview" canvas so you can get a sense of what your trajectory will look like. You can reset the canvas if you delete or edit waypoints. Then, just click generate!
            A text file with the JSON of your path points will be downloaded to your computer.</p>
          <h4>I have more questions!</h4>
          <p>You can find all the code <a href="https://github.com/lydiaxing/snail-motion-profiles2">here</a>, and all my contact info is on Github -- feel free to drop me a line!</p>
          <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
          <p>I would like to give credit to my sources and the resources that helped make this site possible. I used <a href="https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard">Creative Tim's free Material Bootstrap Admin</a>, and the library
            <a href="https://material.angular.io/">Angular Material</a>, to make this website look fancy. I also followed AngularJS' Tour of Heroes tutorial. Last, but not least, I would like to thank "The Math Guy" for his Youtube tutorial on cubic spline
            interpolation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT7F3TWihvk">here</a></p>
